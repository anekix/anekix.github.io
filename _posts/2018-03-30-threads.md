We all have heard things like python is a memory safe language, and memory manageement is done automatically in python.

Its the Garbage collector which is responsible for freeing memory when an object is no longer required by the program.

Consider this program below:
{% highlight python %}

class A:
    def __del__(self):
        print "no more refrence to {}".format(self)

{% endhighlight %}
